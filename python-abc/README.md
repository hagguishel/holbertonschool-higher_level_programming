# Python OOP – Abstract Classes, Interfaces & Subclassing

## 📌 Introduction

Welcome to this project focused on mastering **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python!

Through hands-on exercises, you'll explore key OOP principles such as:
- Abstract classes and interfaces
- Duck typing and polymorphism
- Subclassing built-in Python classes
- Method overriding and customization
- Multiple inheritance and mixins

By the end, you’ll be able to design robust, modular, and reusable Python applications using advanced OOP patterns.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### 🧱 Abstract Classes
- Understand how to create abstract classes using the `abc` module
- Define abstract methods to enforce consistent implementation across subclasses

### 🧩 Interfaces & Duck Typing
- Learn to define and follow contracts without rigid inheritance
- Use duck typing to write more flexible, Pythonic code

### 🧬 Subclassing Built-ins
- Customize behavior of standard types (e.g. `list`, `dict`, `iterator`) through subclassing
- Implement specialized data structures while maintaining Python conventions

### 🔁 Method Overriding
- Override parent class methods to add or change functionality in child classes
- Use `super()` to extend base behaviors cleanly

### ⚙️ Multiple Inheritance
- Understand how Python handles method resolution order (MRO)
- Combine multiple base classes to build complex behaviors

### 🧩 Mixins
- Create reusable functionality that can be composed across unrelated classes
- Promote modularity and avoid deep inheritance trees

## ✅ Getting Started

Each exercise is designed to be self-contained and builds on the previous one. To begin:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate into the project folder.
3. Run each Python file using:
   ```bash
   python3 <filename>.py
