# 🔥 Flask SSR Project – Server-Side Rendering with Python

Welcome to the **Flask SSR Project**, a deep dive into the world of server-side rendering using Python and the Flask framework. In this project, you'll explore how to build fast, dynamic, and SEO-friendly web applications by generating HTML directly from the server using Jinja templates.

---

## 📚 Learning Objectives

✅ Understand what **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** is and how it differs from Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
✅ Learn the **advantages** of SSR in terms of performance, SEO, and user experience
✅ Implement a full **SSR pipeline in Python** with the Flask framework
✅ Use the **Jinja2 templating engine** to dynamically generate HTML content
✅ Read and render data from **JSON**, **CSV**, and **SQLite** sources
✅ Handle **dynamic content** and **user inputs** securely and efficiently

## 🛠️ What You'll Build

You'll create a complete web application in Flask that:

- Serves **HTML pages rendered on the server**
- Uses **Jinja2** to inject dynamic data into templates
- Integrates data from multiple sources: `.json`, `.csv`, and SQLite database
- Handles user interactions and input with SSR logic
- Becomes a **clean, scalable, and SEO-friendly** web platform

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Concept              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** | Pages are fully rendered on the server and sent as HTML to the client      |
| **CSR (Client-Side Rendering)** | Pages are built in the browser using JavaScript and fetched data           |
| **Jinja2**           | A powerful templating engine used in Flask to generate HTML                  |
| **Data Integration** | Read and display content from JSON, CSV, and SQLite                          |
| **Flask Routing**    | Build dynamic routes that respond to user interaction and server logic       |
